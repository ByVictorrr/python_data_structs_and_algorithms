### **2. Recursion**
   - **Understand the Base Case:**
     - Always identify the simplest case that can be solved directly.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - Break down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem.
   - **Common Recursion Problems:**
     - Factorial Calculation
     - Fibonacci Sequence
     - Power of a Number
     - String Reversal

   - **Backtracking:**
     - N-Queens Problem
     - Subsets and Permutations
     - Sudoku Solver

### **3. Recursion with Memory (Dynamic Programming)**
   - **Understanding Memoization:**
     - Store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.
   - **Top-Down Approach (Memoization):**
     - Identify overlapping subproblems.
     - Implement recursive solutions with a cache to store results.
   - **Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation):**
     - Solve subproblems starting from the simplest ones and build up to the solution.
   - **Common DP Problems:**
     - Fibonacci with memoization
     - Climbing Stairs Problem
     - Longest Increasing Subsequence
     - Coin Change Problem
     - 0/1 Knapsack Problem

### **4. Graphs**
   - **Graph Representations:**
     - Adjacency Matrix
     - Adjacency List
   - **Graph Traversal Techniques:**
     - Depth-First Search (DFS)
     - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
     - Detecting Cycles in Graphs (using DFS)
   - **Shortest Path Algorithms:**
     - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
     - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
     - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
   - **Topological Sorting:**
     - Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS-based)
     - DFS-based Topological Sort
   - **Connected Components:**
     - Finding connected components in an undirected graph
     - Strongly connected components in a directed graph (Tarjan’s Algorithm)
   - **Common Graph Problems:**
     - Number of Islands
     - Graph Valid Tree
     - Word Ladder
     - Course Schedule
     - Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal’s and Prim’s Algorithm)

### **5. Additional Tips:**
   - **Time Complexity Analysis:**
     - Always evaluate the time complexity of your recursive and iterative solutions.
   - **Space Complexity:**
     - Be aware of the space complexity, especially when using recursion (due to the call stack).
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - Test your solutions with edge cases (empty input, maximum/minimum values, etc.).
   - **Iterative vs Recursive Approaches:**
     - Practice converting recursive solutions to iterative ones and vice versa.
   - **Visualize Problems:**
     - Draw diagrams for trees and graphs to better understand the problem structure.
